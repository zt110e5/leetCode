# 657. Judge Route Circle

标签（空格分隔）： Java LeetCode    Easy

---

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.
####Example 1:
**Input**: "UD"
**Output**: true
####Example 2:
**Input**: "LL"
**Output**: false


```
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        for(char move : moves.toCharArray()){
            if(move == 'U')
                y++;
            else if(move == 'D')
                y--;
            else if(move == 'L')
                x--;
            else
                x++;
        }
        
        return x==0 & y == 0;
    }
}
```
时间复杂度:O(n),n是moves字符串的长度。
空间复杂度:O(1),In Java, our character array is O(N);
